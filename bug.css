The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not a valid CSS unit (such as a negative value for a width or height), it might lead to unexpected behavior or no visual effect.  For instance, `width: calc(100% - 200px);` will work fine if the container is more than 200px wide, but if it's less, the width will become negative and the element might disappear or behave unexpectedly.  Another issue involves the order of operations. Make sure you understand how `calc()` handles operator precedence.
